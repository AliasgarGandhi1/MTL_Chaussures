                    Flip-flops are a type of light sandal, typically 
                    worn as a form of casual footwear.
                        They consist of a flat sole held loosely on 
                        the foot by a Y-shaped strap
                        known as a toe thong that passes between the 
                        first and second toes and around both sides of 
                        the foot or can be a hard base with a strap across 
                        all the toes (these can also be called sliders or slides).
                    This style of footwear has been worn by the people of many 
                    cultures throughout the world, originating as early as the ancient 
                    Egyptians in 1500 B.C.
